Scire
=====

A power and energy analysis utility for embedded systems.

This utility was initially developed to make analysing current traces made during a Low Power System on Chip Architecture course. The example files are samples from two of the labs and the suffix  numbers are the number of bytes being sent over an 802.15.4 link by an Atmel ATmega128RFA1 board.

Running
-------

The utility depends on PyQtGraph and NumPy. In Ubuntu these can be installed with
```
sudo apt-get install python-pyqtgraph python-numpy
```

Contributing
------------

The project is not being actively developed but feature requests, bugs, and pull requests are most welcome via GitHub Issues or email.
